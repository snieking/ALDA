 * java.util.Queue</a> where you will find more documentation for most of the
 * methods.
 * <p>
 * Please note that you should implement all the functionality of the queue on
 * your own using a <em>singly</em> linked list. You may, of course, create
 * temporary linked lists in methods, but you are not allowed to use any arrays,
 * ArrayLists, LinkedLists, Vectors, or other collections anywhere in your code.
 * <p>
 * The test code assumes that the class has a single constructor that takes the
 * capacity of the queue as a parameter.
 * <p>
 * Do NOT rename this interface!
